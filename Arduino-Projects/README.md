These projects are made by me for me, mostly for university projects or to be added to the CV. 
Anyone is free to use, be inspired, copy, edit or add to the codes/projects.

My name is not to be used in any other projects that I do not give personal permission via mail or any other means.

Any type of credits is greatly appreciated and to be linked to the main repository and optionally one of the socials links.
