These projects are made by me for me, mostly for university projects or to be added to the CV. 
Anyone is free to use, be inspired, copy, edit or add the codes/projects to their own.

My name is not to be used in any other projects that I do not give personal permission.

Any type of credits is greatly appreciated and is to be linked to the main repository and optionally one of the socials links.
